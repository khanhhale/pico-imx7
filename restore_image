How to restore the firmware if any modifications were done (windows pc needed) 

A. Restore factory default settings

===================================
 
To restore your PICO-PI-IMX7D to the default settings follow instructions below.

If your board is already (still) using default settings, skip ahead to section B.


Step 1.

Download NXP Mfgtools from

https://github.com/khanhhale/pico-imx7/blob/master/mfgtools.zip


and the factory default bootloader from

https://github.com/khanhhale/pico-imx7/blob/master/u-boot.imx


Step 2

Extract Mfgtools onto a Windows computer. Inside the Mfgtools folder, place the downloaded u-boot.imx file in Profiles\Linux\OS Firmware\files\brillo\pico_imx7d replacing any u-boot.imx already there (if there is one).


Step 3

Then set the boot jumpers on your board to serial download mode, as described inhttp://www.nxp.com/assets/documents/data/en/user-guides/PICO-IMX7D-USG.pdf

(or http://www.nxp.com/assets/documents/data/en/quick-start-guide/PICO-iMX7D-QSG.pdf )


Step 4

Attach your board with a USB type C cable to a USB host port on your computer.

Execute the VBS script

mfgtool2-brillo-mx7d-pico-emmc-firmware.vbs

by double clicking on it (located in the Mfgtools folder).


Step 5

Mfgtools starts, and should indicate that there is a HID device attached.

Press start, and wait. The install happens in two steps, and do not detach your board or stop it until there is a green status bar and a "done" message.


Step 6

Detach the board, set the boot jumpers to emmc boot mode, and reattach the board. "fastboot devices" command should list a fastboot device.


Your board is now in factory default mode.


On the debug console, it might notify about a missing misc partition etc, but these are not a critical problems. Just proceed.


B. Install Android Things

=========================


To install Android things, follow the instructions at https://developer.android.com/things/hardware/imx7d.html

 Note: linux users might need an even newer fastboot version than listed in the instructions. If the command "fastboot --version" fails, your version is probably too old.

 The latest linux version of fastboot can be downloaded from https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-linux.zip
